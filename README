Manual of IMPre
=====

# Introduction

IMPre - predict BCR and TCR germline V/J genes and alleles using deep-sequencing data for earrangement repertoire. It utilizes Clust_Seed algorithm to classify sequences and de-novel assembly for extension. V and J gene/allele are inferred seperately. FASTA format is repqured.

# System Requirement

It runs on 64-bit Linux systems. for 1E6 sequences as input, about maximum 2.5Gb memory would be required.
Perl and C need to be installed for you system

# Installation

   1. Before use it, perl(https://www.perl.org/get.html) need to be installed.
   2. Download the IMPre.tar.gz to your directory, uncompress it.
        tar -zxvf IMPre.tar.gz

# Usage

###1. Create shell
   perl IMPre.pl
        Compulsory: for sequence include C region, -i -o -n -p; for others (sequence with plus strand), -i -o -n
        Optionally: others
        all the parameters have the detail introduction if you run "perl IMPre.pl"
   this step will create multiple directory and shells

        [parameters]

            -i      <S> input fa file, *.fa or *.fa.gz

            -j_seed <I> the length of seed for J clustering [40]
            -v_seed_m <I> the last bases masked for V seed [20](recommendation:TRB/IGH=20,TRA/IGk/L=10)
            -j_seed_m <I> the first bases masked for J seed [5]
            -vn     <I> the number of cluster for V gene [200](recommendation:TRB=200,IGH=300)
            -jn     <I> the number of cluster for J gene [30]

                    ****    assembly:seed extension    *************
            -v_mr       Rate of the read number needed for V seed extension[0.15]
            -v_nr       Rate of the unique read number needed for V seed extension[0.12]
            -j_mr       Rate of the read number needed for J seed extension [0.12]
            -j_nr       Rate of the unique read number needed for J seed extension [0.1]

                    ****    optimization:combine && filter     *************
            -vf_ratio    <I> for V gene, ratio(#(5bp trimmed)supporing seq/#supproing seq) for filtering [1.5]
            -vf_ave2     <I> for V gene, rate2(#more 5bp/average*100) for filtering [5]
            -jf_ratio    <I> for J gene, ratio(#(5bp trimmed)supporing seq/#supproing seq) for filtering [1.5]
            -jf_ave2     <I> for J gene, rate2(#more 5bp/average*100) for filtering [5]

            -vf_ave      <I> for V gene, depth rate1(#(5bp trimmed)supporting/average*100) for filtering [2]
            -jf_ave      <I> for J gene, depth rate1(#(5bp trimmed)supporting/average*100) for filtering [0.5](recommendation:TRB=0.5,IGH=2)
            -v_min_e     <I> for V gene, the mismatch number for last clustering to determine marjor/minor alleles [3]
            -j_min_e     <I> for J gene, the mismatch number for last clustering to determine marjor/minor alleles [3]

            -v_lf        <I> the minimum length for output [50]
            -j_lf        <I> the minimum length for output [40]

Note
            1. If the sequence including C region, the compulsory parameters: -i -o -n -p
            2. If the sequence without C region, the sequence must be forward strand and the compulsory parameters: -i -o -n
            3. There are lots of parameters, however, almost of them are not need to reset, except several one by recommendation.


###2. Run shell
   2.1 it can easy to run the general sh 'Execute_all.sh': sh Execute_all.sh
   2.2 run multiple shells in seperately,so V/J could be run in parallel.
        sh *_data_processing.sh
        sh *_J_clustering.sh
        sh *_V_clustering.sh
        sh *_J_assembly.sh
        sh *_J_optimization.sh
        sh *_V_assembly.sh
        sh *_V_optimization.sh

# Output
###1. output files:

        1. *_V_Germline.final.fa
        2. *_J_Germline.final.fa
        
###2. file format
        FASTA format

# Testing

        directory Test/ has a data for testing
        run.sh:
        perl ../IMPre.pl -i Test.TRB.fa.gz -p TRB_C_region.txt -n T -o . -v_min_e 1 -j_min_e 1 -v_seed 40
